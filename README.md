# Wisent genome assembly

Set of scripts to run the analyses presented in Bortoluzzi et al. (2024), including:

1. Genome assembly of the wisent;
2. Repetitive sequence analysis (RepeatModeler + RepeatMasker);
3. Phylogenetic tree construction;
4. Synteny;
5. Alignment of short-read DNA samples;
6. Genome-wide heterozygosity and ROH;
7. Pangenome analysis.

The repository contains also scripts to run analyses that were not included in the final manuscript (e.g., treemix, admixture, MSMC, PCA, relatedness).

## Requirements
python v3.8.16\\
R v4.0.2
